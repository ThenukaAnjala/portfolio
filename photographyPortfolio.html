            <p>
              Post-processing in this project focuses on optimizing images, animations, and user interactions for performance and aesthetics. Tools like `next/image` ensure efficient image rendering with lazy loading and responsive sizing. CSS transitions and hover effects are carefully crafted for smooth animations, enhancing the visual appeal. Regular code reviews, linting, and debugging maintain high-quality code. Deployment involves minifying assets and leveraging a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast global delivery. Post-launch analytics are used to refine the user experience further.
